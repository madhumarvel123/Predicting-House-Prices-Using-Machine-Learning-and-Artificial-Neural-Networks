The project uses machine learning and artificial neural networks to predict house prices at the core of construction management and urban development. In this study, house price prediction was done using the King County Housing Dataset with appropriate methodologies like data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, and ensemble modeling. These are important attributes of property value and help in construction project planning, resource allocation, and market assessment. Integration of ensemble techniques, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, into ANN models further enhances its value for data-driven approaches toward improvement in decision making within construction management.
